%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INSERINDO COMENTÁRIOS EM ARQUIVOS .bib %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% 1. Como em outros arquivos LaTeX, comentários são iniciados por "%" e,
%    portanto, é preciso usar "\%" para imprimir o caractere "%". Esquecer
%    disso pode gerar erros difíceis de encontrar!
%
% 2. Não é possível inserir comentários dentro de uma entrada, apenas fora.
%
% 3. Não é possível incluir o caractere arroba em um comentário.
%
% 4. Se quiser desabilitar temporariamente um campo ("comentar" o campo),
%    troque seu nome para algum nome inválido, como "author-disable".
%    Se quiser fazer alguma observação permanente dentro de uma entrada,
%    você também pode usar algum nome de campo inválido, como "lembrete",
%    ou usar o campo "annotation", que normalmente é ignorado.
%
% 5. Se quiser desabilitar temporariamente uma entrada inteira ("comentar" a
%    entrada), não basta colocar "%" nas linhas correspondentes por causa do
%    caractere arroba; também é preciso remover a arroba.
%
% 6. Na verdade, as regras não são bem essas, mas segui-las é uma boa ideia:
%    https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/262282
%
% Por exemplo, esta entrada está comentada, ou seja, não tem efeito: se
% houvesse uma referência a ela no texto, a referência ficaria inválida.
% Observe que, para isso, o caractere arroba foi apagado!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% O CAMPO "MONTH" %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% biblatex prefere o uso do campo "date" para definir ano, mês etc. No
% entanto, se você quiser garantir compatibilidade tanto com biblatex
% quanto com bibtex, use os campos "year" e "month". Ambos reconhecem
% diversos formatos para o campo "month", mas apenas um funciona
% corretamente com os dois: o nome do mês em inglês, abreviado com três
% letras minúsculas e sem chaves, ou seja:
%
% ...
% author = {Somebody},
% year = {2011},
% month = oct,

	abstract      = {Context: The last several years saw the emergence of AI assistants for code -- multi-purpose AI-based helpers in software engineering. As they become omnipresent in all aspects of software development, it becomes critical to understand their usage patterns. Objective: We aim to better understand how specifically developers are using AI assistants, why they are not using them in certain parts of their development workflow, and what needs to be improved in the future. Methods: In this work, we carried out a large-scale survey aimed at how AI assistants are used, focusing on specific software development activities and stages. We collected opinions of 481 programmers on five broad activities: (a) implementing new features, (b) writing tests, (c) bug triaging, (d) refactoring, and (e) writing natural-language artifacts, as well as their individual stages. Results: Our results provide a novel comparison of different stages where AI assistants are used that is both comprehensive and detailed. It highlights specific activities that developers find less enjoyable and want to delegate to an AI assistant, e.g., writing tests and natural-language artifacts. We also determine more granular stages where AI assistants are used, such as generating tests and generating docstrings, as well as less studied parts of the workflow, such as generating test data. Among the reasons for not using assistants, there are general aspects like trust and company policies, as well as more concrete issues like the lack of project-size context, which can be the focus of the future research. Conclusion: The provided analysis highlights stages of software development that developers want to delegate and that are already popular for using AI assistants, which can be a good focus for features aimed to help developers right now. The main reasons for not using AI assistants can serve as a guideline for future work.}

Consequently, the identification of duplicated code, clone detection, has been a very active area of research in recent years. Up to now, however, no substantial investigation of the consequences of code cloning on program correctness has been carried out. To remedy this shortcoming, this paper presents the results of a large-scale case study that was undertaken to find out if inconsistent changes to cloned code can indicate faults. For the analyzed commercial and open source systems we not only found that inconsistent changes to clones are very frequent but also identified a significant number of faults induced by such changes. The clone detection tool used in the case study implements a novel algorithm for the detection of inconsistent clones. It is available as open source to enable other researchers to use it as basis for further investigations.},
